# Hack a thing 1 - WebGL particle toy

## Jake Herman

### What is it
Live demos are better than words: check it out here.

It's a particle simulator that draws particles on a canvas and lets the user interact
with them using the mouse. Click to accelerate and right click to do something cool

### Why
I have played with OpenGL before and thought it'd be cool to build something with it that
can run in a website. I've also been interested in Typescript and new web technologies
since most of my experience is in backend systems, so this seemed like a cool way
to combine them. Also (hopefully), it looks cool and is fun to play with.

### New technologies
* Typescript
* WebGL 2

### What didn't work
* I tried for a while to get transform feedback to work with a single buffer rather
than separate input/output buffers, but I never could get it working quite right.
